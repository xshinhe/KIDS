New features in version 5.7 devel6

- keyword driven input
- selective Multi-state Tully working for molpro & numerical molcas
- parallel numerics for molcas (PT2 gradient computations)
- numerical derivative couplings for molcas working
- updated TDDFT interface
- fixed MM xfield input format to handle systems >99 Angstrom (now %14.8f)
- CUDA support for Amber14
- Amber gradients through MD velocities to speed up MM
- name of dynamics output file is now "dynamic.out" 
- variable handling via system exchange file "cobram-sef"

New features in version 5.7 beta

- almost all floating individual COBRAM-5.6 versions combined
- removed all hardcoded paths for QM programs, use variables MOLCAS_SCRIPT / MOLPRO_EXE now
- Support for numerical molcas gradients 
- Turbomole QM/MM interface
- Support for unmodified versions of Amber 10-14, Amber 8/9 are no longer included!
- rudimentary support for DFT-MRCI
- added mod_real.py to modify any part of the real.crd structure
- use of GHOST atoms in molcas

New features in version 5.6 beta

- molcas79 interface implemented
- use of RI and reaction field in molcas79
- copy molcas/molpro orbitals of each step into separate folder

New features in version 5.5 beta

- new Atom link scheme to fix hydrogen link along bond axis according
- to Thiel et. al. paper. This is now also the default option
- atom link working in optxg and md modules with up to 3 hydrogen Link atoms
  per center
- charge hopping now no longer default

New features in version 5.4 beta:

- only very minor changes

New features in version 5.3 beta:

- fixed problems with Excited state molpro MD at hopping point
- added support for molecules >50 Atoms (molpro empty line bug)
- rudimentary dft-mrci interface

New features in version 5.2 beta:

- Added support for molpro2010
- cobram stops when cobram.out is found in the current directory to prevent
  overwrite by mistake
- reads molpro RHF/RKS charges, energies and forces
- switch implemented to avoid optimization from stopping when wavefunction
  does not converge (198=1, carefully check that final geometry HAS
- converged!)
- switch to delete work.wfu every 10 steps to avoid crash of molpro MP2
  dynamics
- separate thresholds for activating surface hopping (86=N in kcal/mol)
  and switching off molpro CASSCF StateAveraging (93=N in kcal/mol)
- optimizations now using g09 code (thanks to Marco Stenta!), fixed gaussian
  MD-interface, ADD OPT=nomicro in optxg command line!!
- separate bond-distances for link atoms bound to C, O and N (IOPS 21 22 23,
- thanks to Artur!)
- FREQ calculations now also provide relative IR intensities
